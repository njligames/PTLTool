# Green: The Platinum Experts are completing the hours! :thumbs:
# Yellow: We recommend to contact the Experts so they can improve their hours.
# Red: Please inform the Experts that they are not meeting the expected hourly commitment and provide specific comments about their overall performance.
# You can always appeal for someone, in that case they will appear as Red-Appeal (in case the appeal was accepted)
# Red-Demotion: There isnâ€™t a possibility to appeal and demotion is imperative (0 hours in 5 weeks).
