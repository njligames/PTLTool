As a Platinum Coder, we follow these three principles:
	1. Time - Minimum 15 hours
	2. Quality - 4/5 or 5/5 stars
	3. Communication - Please keep in contact with me.

When you are in my Platinum POD, it is important to me that we act proactivly so that we are ready when issues may arise.

When I joined the Platinum Team, I was presented with these four commitments.

The Four Commitments of a Winning Team
    1. Know your job
    2. Do what youâ€™re asked
    3. Make people look good
    4. Look out for others

I think these four commitments will guide us to build a strong team!
